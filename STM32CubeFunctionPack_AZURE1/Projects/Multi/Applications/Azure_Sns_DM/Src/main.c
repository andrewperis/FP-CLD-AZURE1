 *
 * <b>Introduction</b>
 *
 * FP-CLD-AZURE1 provides a software running on STM32 which offers a complete middleware to build applications based on 
 * WiFi/Ethernet connectivity (SPW01SA/Nucleo-F429ZI) and to connect STM32 Nucleo boards (or B-L475E-IOT01A Discovery kit IoT node) with Microsoft Azure IoT services.
 * The software leverages functionalities provided by the following expansion boards (for Nucleo boards)
 *    -X-NUCLEO-IKS01A1 or X-NUCLEO-IKS01A2 featuring temperature, humidity, pressure and motion MEMS sensors
 *    -X-NUCLEO-IDW01M1 a Wi-Fi evaluation board based on the SPWF01SA module
 *    -X-NUCLEO-NFC01A1 a Dynamic NFC tag evaluation board

 * FP-CLD-AZURE1 is an function package software for STM32Cube. The software runs on the STM32 micro-controller and 
 * includes drivers that recognize WiFi/Ethernet module (SPWF01SA/Nucleo-F429ZI), sensor devices and dynamic NFC/RFID tag (M24SR64-Y).
 * It also includes the porting of the Microsoft Azure IoT device SDK for easy connection with 
 * Azure IoT services. The expansion software is built on STM32Cube software technology 
 * to ease portability across different STM32 microcontrollers. The software comes with examples for registering the 
 * device on Microsoft Azure IoT Hub, transmit data and receive commands, and allow Device Management with FOTA capability (Not for Nucleo F401RE)
 *
 * This application allows the user to control the initialization phase via UART.
 * Launch a terminal application and set the UART port to 115200 bps, 8 bit, No Parity, 1 stop bit
 *
 *                     ----------------------------------------
 *                     | VERY IMPORTANT For Nucleo != F401RE: |
 *                     ----------------------------------------
 * 1) This example support the Firmware-Over-The-Air (FOTA) update.
 *
 * 2) This example must run starting at address 0x08004000 in memory and works ONLY if the BootLoader 
 * is saved at the beginning of the FLASH (address 0x08000000)
 *
 *
 * For each IDE (IAR/µVision/System Workbench) there are some scripts CleanAzure1mbedTLS.bat/CleanAzure1mbedTLS.sh that makes the following operations:
 * - Full Flash Erase
 * - Load the BootLoader on the rigth flash region
 * - Load the Program (after the compilation) on the rigth flash region (This could be used for a FOTA)
 * - Dump back one single binary that contain BootLoader+Program that could be
 *  flashed at the flash beginning (address 0x08000000) (This COULD BE NOT used for FOTA)
 * - Reset the board
