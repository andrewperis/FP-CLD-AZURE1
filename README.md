See for the original and latest details, http://www.st.com/en/embedded-software/fp-cld-azure1.html

FP-CLD-AZURE1 is an STM32 ODE function pack which lets you safely connect your IoT node to Microsoft Azure IoT, transmit sensor data and receive commands from Azure cloud applications.

It fully supports Azure device management primitives and includes a sample implementation for firmware update over the air (FOTA). By using a mobile device with NFC, Wi-Fi and Ethernet connectivity links are easily configured.

This software, together with the suggested combination of STM32 and ST devices, can be used, for example, to develop sensor-to-cloud applications for a broad range of use cases, such as smart home or smart industry.

The software runs on the STM32 microcontroller and includes drivers for the Wi-Fi and Ethernet connectivity, dynamic NFC/RFID tag, as well as motion and environmental sensors.
